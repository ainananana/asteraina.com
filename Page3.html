<h2><center><b>Did You Know? Fascinating Facts About Our Solar System</h2></center></b>
 
<b><u>Planetary Oddities</b></u><br>
 
<br><br>Venus's Backwards Rotation: Unlike most planets, Venus rotates clockwise (retrograde rotation), possibly due to a massive impact early in its history.

 
 
 
<br><br>Uranus's Sideways Tilt: Uranus rotates on its side, almost parallel to its orbital plane, likely the result of a colossal collision.

 
<br><br>Jupiter's Volcanic Moon: Io, one of Jupiter's moons, is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, with eruptions spewing sulfur hundreds of kilometers into space.

 
<br><br>Mars's Gigantic Features: Mars boasts Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and Valles Marineris, a canyon system ten times longer than Earth's Grand Canyon.

 
 
 
<br><br>Neptune's Unexpected Heat: Despite its distance from the Sun, Neptune radiates more heat than it receives, a mystery yet to be fully explained.

 
 
 
<br><br><br><b><u>Beyond the Planets</b></u>
 
<br><br>The Kuiper Belt: This region beyond Neptune contains countless icy bodies, including dwarf planets like Pluto.

 
<br><br>The Oort Cloud: A hypothetical spherical shell of icy objects surrounding the solar system, potentially the source of long-period comets.

 
<br><br>Asteroids and Comets: Millions of asteroids, mostly between Mars and Jupiter, and thousands of comets, icy bodies with tails, populate our solar system.

 
<br><br><br><b><u>Solar System Scale and Dynamics</b></u><br><br>
 
<br><br>Solar System's Size: The solar system is vast; Voyager 1, launched in 1977, took over 35 years to reach interstellar space, and will take thousands more to leave the Oort Cloud.


<br><br>Planetary Alignment: All planets could theoretically fit between the Earth and the Moon.
