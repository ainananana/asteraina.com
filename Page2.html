<h2><b>What is a Planet?</h2></b>

<h2><u><b>The Definition of a Planet</h2></b></u>
The word goes back to the ancient Greek word planēt, and it means <b>“wanderer.”</b>

<br><br>A more modern definition can be found in the <em>Merriam-Webster dictionary</em> which defines a planet as <b>“any of the large bodies
 <br>that revolve around the Sun in the solar system.”</b>

<br><br>In <em>2006</em>, the <b>International Astronomical Union (IAU)</b> – a group of astronomers that names objects in our solar system – agreed 
<br>on their own definition of the word <b>“planet.”</b> This new definition changed caused Pluto’s famous </b>“demotion”</em> to a dwarf planet.

<br><br><br><h4><b>The definition of a planet adopted by the IAU says a planet must do three things:</h4></b>
<p>
<b>1.</b>  <em>It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).</em>
<br><b>2.</b> <em>It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.</em>
<br><b>3.</b> <em>It must be big enough that its gravity has cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.</em>
</p>

<h2><b>MERCURY</h2></b>
The <em>smallest planet</em> in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, <b>Mercury</b> is only slightly larger than Earth’s Moon. From the 
<br>surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would
<br>be as much as seven times brighter.<center><img src="iu.jpg"></center>

<br><br><b>Mercury’s surface temperatures</b> are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can 
<br>reach highs of <b>800°F (430°C).</b> Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as <b>-290°F (-180°C).</b>

<br><br>Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is <em>not the hottest planet</em> in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks 
<br>to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the <em>fastest planet</em>, zipping around the Sun every <b>88 Earth days.</b>

<br><br>With a radius of <b>1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers)</b>, Mercury is a little more than <b>1/3</b> the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a 
<br>nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a <b>blueberry.</b>

<br><br>From an average distance of <b>36 million miles (58 million kilometers)</b>, Mercury is <b>0.4 astronomical units</b> away from the Sun. <em>One
 <br>astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU)</em>, is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight <b>3.2 minutes</b> 
<br>to travel from the Sun to Mercury.


<br><br><br><h2><b>Orbit and Rotation</h2></b>
Mercury’s highly eccentric, <em>egg-shaped orbit</em> takes the planet as close as <b>29 million miles (47 million kilometers)</b> and as far as 
<br><b>43 million miles (70 million kilometers)</b> from the Sun. It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 
<br><b>9 miles (47 kilometers) per second</b>, faster than any other planet.

<br><br>Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation <b>every 59 Earth days.</b> But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical
<br> orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other
<br> planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens 
<br>in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals <b>176 Earth days</b> – just over
 <br><b>two years</b> on Mercury.<center><img src="MERCURY.jpeg"></center>

<br><br>Mercury’s axis of rotation is tilted just <b>2 degrees</b> with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. That means it spins
 <br>nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience seasons as many other planets do.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Moons</h2></b>
Mercury doesn’t have <b>moons.</b>

<br><br><br><h2><b>Rings</h2></b>
Mercury doesn’t have <b>rings.</b>

<br><br><br><h2><b>Formation</h2></b>
Mercury formed about <b>4.5 billion years ago</b> when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet 
<br>nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a <b>central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.</b>

<br><br><br><h2><b>Surface</h2></b>
Mercury’s surface resembles that of <b>Earth’s Moon</b>, scarred by many impact craters resulting from <em>collisions with meteoroids 
<br>and comets.</em> Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased <b>artists, musicians, or authors, including children’s 
<br>author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.</b>


<br><br><br><h2><b>Atmosphere</h2></b>
Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the <b>solar wind and 
<br>striking meteoroids</b>. <b>Mercury’s exosphere</b> is composed mostly of <em>oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.</em>

<h2><b>VENUS</h2></b>
<b>Venus</b> is the second planet from the Sun, and our closest planetary neighbor. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, 
<br>and is sometimes called Earth’s twin.<center><img src="oo.jpg"></center>
<br><br><br><h2><b>Orbit and Rotation</h2></b>
Spending a day on Venus would be quite a disorienting experience – that is, if your spacecraft or spacesuit could protect you 
<br>from temperatures in the range of <b>900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 Celsius)</b>. For one thing, your “day” would be 243 Earth days long –
<br> longer even than a Venus year (one trip around the Sun), which takes only 225 Earth days. For another, because of the planet’s 
<br>extremely slow rotation, sunrise to sunset would take <b>117 Earth days</b>. And by the way, the Sun would rise in the west and set in 
<br>the east, because Venus spins backward compared to Earth.

<br><br>While you’re waiting, don’t expect any seasonal relief from the unrelenting temperatures. On Earth, with its spin axis tilted
 <br>by about <b>23 degrees</b>, we experience summer when our part of the planet (our hemisphere) receives the Sun’s rays more directly – 
<br>a result of that tilt. In winter, the tilt means the rays are less direct. No such luck on Venus: Its very slight tilt is only three
 <br>degrees, which is too little to produce noticeable seasons.

<br><br><h2><b>Moons</h2></b>
Venus is one of only <b>two planets</b> in our solar system that doesn’t have a moon, but it does have a quasi-satellite that has officially
 <br>been named Zoozve. This object was discovered on <b>Nov. 11, 2002</b>, by <b>Brian Skiff at the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS)</b>
 <br>in <b>Flagstaff, Arizona</b>, a project funded by NASA that ended in <b>February 2008.</b>  

<br><br><b>Quasi-satellites</b>, sometimes called <b>quasi-moons</b>, are asteroids that orbit the Sun while staying close to a planet. A quasi-satellite’s 
<br>orbit usually is more oblong and less stable than the planet’s orbit. In time, the shape of a quasi-satellite’s orbit may change and it
<br>may move away from the planet. 

<br><br><h2><b>Surface</h2></b>
<b>The Soviet Union</b> sent a series of probes to Venus between <b>1961 and 1984</b> as part of its <b>Venera program (Venera is Russian for Venus). </b>
<br>Ten probes made it to the surface, and a few functioned briefly after landing. The longest survivor lasted two hours; the shortest, 
<br><b>23 minutes</b>. Photos snapped before the landers fried show a barren, dim, and rocky landscape, and a sky that is likely some shade of 
<br><b>sulfur yellow.</b><center><img src="kl.jpg"></center>


<br><br><br><h2><b>Atmosphere</h2></b>
<b>Venus’ atmosphere</b> is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even
<br> than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly <b>carbon dioxide</b> – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect 
<br>on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a 
<br>corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease.


<br><br><br><h2><b>Earth</h2></b>
<b>Earth</b> – our home planet – is the <em>third planet</em> from the Sun, and the fifth largest planet. It’s the only place we know of inhabited
 <br>by living things.

<br><br>While Earth is only the <em>fifth largest planet</em> in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the 
<br>surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made
 <br>of <em>rock and metal.</em>

<br><br><br><b>Earth</b> is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from <em>Greek or Roman mythology</em>. The name was taken 
<br>from <em>Old English and Germanic</em>. It simply means <b>“the ground.”</b> There are, of course, many names for our planet in the thousands of 
<br>languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.<center><img src="ll.jpg"></center>

<br><br>Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is unique 
<br>in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods
<br> of time. Earth’s vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about <em>3.8 billion years ago.</em>

<br><br>Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing effects of climate change.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Size and Distance</h2></b>
With an equatorial diameter of <b>7926 miles (12,760 kilometers)</b>, Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth
 <br>largest planet in our solar system.

<br><br>From an average distance of <b>93 million miles (150 million kilometers)</b>, Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun 
<br>because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly
 <br>compare planets’ distances from the Sun.

<br><br><br>It takes about <b>eight minutes</b> for light from the Sun to reach our planet.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Orbit and Rotation</h2></b>
As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every <b>23.9 hours.</b> It takes <b>365.25 days</b> to complete one trip around the Sun. 
<br>That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly 
<br>calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year
 <br>it’s added to is called a <b>leap year.</b><center><img src="mp.jpg"></center>

<br><br><br>Earth’s axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth’s orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our 
<br>yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere 
<br>is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar 
<br>heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres 
<br>receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Moons</h2></b>
Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many 
<br>ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our planet’s wobble, which has made the climate 
<br>less variable over thousands of years.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Formation</h2></b>
When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas
<br> and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky 
<br>mantle, and a solid crust.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Structure</h2></b>
Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet’s center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle,
 <br>and crust.

<br><br><br>The Inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles (1,221 kilometers) in radius. There the 
<br>temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. 
<br>This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.

<br><br><br>In between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about
<br> 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth’s crust, goes about 
<br>19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 
<br>3 miles (5 kilometers) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle.<center><img src="mm.jpg"></center>


<br><br><br><h2><b>Surface</h2></b>
Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. Earth’s lithosphere, which includes the crust 
<br>(both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving. For
 <br>example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth 
<br>of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to 
<br>make mountains, or split and separate.

<br><br>Earth’s global ocean, which covers nearly 70% of the planet’s surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles
 <br>(4 kilometers) and contains 97% of Earth’s water. Almost all of Earth’s volcanoes are hidden under these oceans.
<br><br> Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater. Earth’s
<br>longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. It is four times longer 
<br>than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Atmosphere</h2></b>
Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases such as argon,
 <br>carbon dioxide, and neon. The atmosphere affects Earth’s long-term climate and short-term local weather and shields us 
<br>from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun. It also protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn 
<br>up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the night sky, before they can strike the surface as meteorites.


<h2><b>MARS</h2></b>
Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun – is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet
<br> has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.
<br><br><br>Introduction
<br><br>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it’s the only planet where we’ve sent rovers to roam the 
<br>alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere,
<br> billions of years ago.<center><img src="MARS.jpeg"></center>

<br><br>Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. 
<br>The Egyptians called it “Her Desher,” meaning “the red one.”

<br><br>Even today, it is frequently called the “Red Planet” because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, 
<br>causing the surface to look red.

<br><br>Scientists don’t expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they’re looking for signs of life
<br> that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Size and Distance</h2></b>
<br>With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, 
<br>Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.

<br><br><br>From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun.
<br> One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight
<br> 13 minutes to travel 
<br>from the Sun to Mars.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Orbit and Rotation</h2></b>
<br>As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours)
<br>. Martian days are called sols – short for “solar day.” A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.

<br><br>Mars’ axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity
 <br>with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons 
<br>here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it’s farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are 
<br>evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars’
<br> elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.

<br><br><br>Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in the northern hemisphere
 <br>(spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern winter
 <br>is 178 sols.

<br><br><br><br><h2><b>Moons</h2></b>
<br><br>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They’re potato-shaped because they have too little mass 
<br>for gravity to make them spherical.

<br><br>The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.

<br><br>Mars’ moon Phobos is seen against the darkness of space.

<br><br>Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep grooves on its surface. It is slowly
<br> moving towards Mars and will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.

<br><br>Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther away from Mars. Oddly-shaped Deimos
<br> is covered in loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it appear smoother than pockmarked Phobos.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Rings</h2></b>
<br>Mars has no rings. However, in 50 million years when Phobos crashes into Mars or breaks apart, it could create a dusty
<br> ring around the Red Planet.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Formation</h2></b>
<br>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled
<br> swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its 
<br>fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.

<br><br><br><h2><b>Structure</h2></b>
<br>Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It’s made of
 <br>iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers)
<br> thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30
 <br>miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.<center><img src="gg.jpg"></center>

<br><br><h2><b>Atmosphere</h2></b>
<br>Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would 
<br>be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars’ sparse atmosphere
<br> doesn’t offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.

<br><br><br>The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees 
<br>Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet.
<br> If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees
<br> Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).

<br><br>Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, 
<br>it can be months before all of the dust settles.
