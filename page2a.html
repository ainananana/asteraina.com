<h1><b><center>THE JOVIAN PLANETS</h1></b></center>
<h2><b>JUPITER</h2></b>

<b>Jupiter</b> is a world of extremes. It’s the <em>largest planet</em> in our solar system – if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could<br>
 fit inside. It’s also the <em>oldest planet</em>, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun’s formation <b>4.6 billion years <br>
ago.</b> But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking about <b>9.9 hours</b> to spin around once on its axis.<br><br><center><img src="11.jpg"></center>

<br><br><em>Jupiter’s signature stripes and swirls</em> are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of <b>hydrogen<br>
 and helium</b>. The dark orange stripes are called <b>belts</b>, while the lighter bands are called <b>zones</b>, and they flow east and west in <br>
opposite directions. Jupiter’s iconic <b>Great Red Spot</b> is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.<br>

Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that<br> 
this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br><br><br>

While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa is<br>
 one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust,<br>
 where life could possibly be supported.<br>

<h2><b>Size and Distance</h2></b>
With a radius of <b>43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers)</b>, Jupiter is <b>11 times</b> wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter<br>
 would be about as big as a <b>basketball</b>.<br><br><br>

From an average distance of <b>484 million miles (778 million kilometers)</b>, Jupiter is <b>5.2 astronomical units</b> away from the Sun. One <br>
astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes to <br>
travel from the Sun to Jupiter.<br><br>

<h2><b>Orbit and Rotation</h2></b>
Jupiter has the <em>shortest day</em> in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes <b>9.9 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or<br>
 spin around once)</b>, and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about <b>12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).</b><br>

<h2><b>Moons</h2></b>
With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system.<br>

Jupiter has <b>95 moons</b> that are officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union. The four largest moons – <b>Io, Europa,<br>
 Ganymede, and Callisto</b> – were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. <br>
These four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites, and they’re some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system.<br>

Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even bigger than <br>
the planet Mercury).<br><center><img src="111.jpg"></center>

<h2><b>Rings</h2></b>
Discovered in 1979 by <b>NASA’s Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter’s rings</b> were a surprise. The rings are composed of small, dark <br>
particles, and they are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun. Data from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that Jupiter’s<br>
 ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the giant planet’s small innermost moons.<br>


<h2><b>Formation</h2></b>
Jupiter took shape along with rest of the solar system about <b>4.6 billion years ago</b>. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust <br>
together to form this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the formation of the Sun, ending up with more <br>
than twice the combined material of the other bodies in the solar system. In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a <b>star</b>,<br>
 but it did not grow massive enough to ignite.<br>

<h2><b>Structure</h2></b>
The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun – mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and <br>
temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system –<br>
 an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water. Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet’s center, the <br>
pressure becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms, making the liquid electrically conducting like metal.<br>
 Jupiter’s fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, with the spinning of the liquid metallic <br>
hydrogen acting like a <b>dynamo</b>, generating the planet’s powerful magnetic field.<br><center><img src="JUPITER.jpeg"></center>

<h2><b>Surface</h2></b>
As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a spacecraft would<br>
 have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep <br>
inside the planet crush, melt, and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.Orbit and Rotation<br>
Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on Saturn takes only <b>10.7 hours (the time it takes for Saturn to <br>
rotate or spin around once)</b>, and Saturn makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Saturnian time) in about <b>29.4 Earth years<br>
 (10,756 Earth days)</b>.<br><br>
<br>


Its axis is tilted by <b>26.73 degrees</b> with respect to its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to Earth's <b>23.5-degree tilt</b>. This<br>
 means that, like Earth, Saturn experiences seasons.<br>


<h2><b>Atmosphere</h2></b>
Jupiter’s appearance is a tapestry of colorful stripes and spots – the cloud bands that encircle the planet, and the<br>
 cyclonic storms dotting it from pole to pole. The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in its <b>“skies”</b><br>
 that, taken together, span about <b>44 miles (71 kilometers)</b>. The top cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the<br>
 middle layer is likely made of <b>ammonium hydrosulfide crystals</b>. The innermost layer may be made of <b>water ice and vapor</b>.<br>


<h2><b>SATURN</h2></b>

Saturn is the <em>sixth planet</em> from the Sun, and the second-largest planet in our solar system.<br>

Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of <em>hydrogen and helium</em>. Saturn is not the only planet<br>
 to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn’s. Saturn also has dozens of moons.<br>

From the jets of water that spray from Saturn’s moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system <br>
is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.<br>

Saturn’s environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize <br>
this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br><center><img src="22.jpg"></center>

While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.<br>
 Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life.<br>

<h2><b>Size and Distance</h2></b>
With an equatorial diameter of about <em>74,897 miles (120,500 kilometers)</em>, Saturn is <b>9</b> times wider than Earth. If Earth were the <br>
size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a volleyball.<br><br>

From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. <br>
One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight <br>
80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn.<br>

<h2><b>Orbit and Rotation</h2></b>
Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours (the time it takes for <br>
Saturn to rotate or spin around once), and Saturn makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Saturnian time) in about <br>
29.4 Earth years <b>(10,756 Earth days).</b>
<br>
Its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees with respect to its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to Earth’s 23.5-degree tilt.<br>
 This means that, like Earth, Saturn experiences seasons.<br>

<h2><b>Rings</h2></b>
Saturn’s rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, <br>
torn apart by Saturn’s powerful gravity. They are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials <br>
such as dust. The ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house. A few particles are<br>
 as large as mountains. The rings would look mostly white if you looked at them from the cloud tops of Saturn, and interestingly, <br>
each ring orbits at a different speed around the planet.<br><center><img src="222.jpg"></center>

<h2><b>Formation</h2></b>
Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust <br>
in to become this gas giant. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where <br>
it is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that<br>
 make up the Sun.

<h2><b>Structure</h2></b>
Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At Saturn’s center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel<br>
 surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by intense pressure and heat. It is enveloped by liquid metallic<br>
 hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen –similar to Jupiter’s core but considerably smaller.<br>

It's hard to Imagine, but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system with an average density that is less than water.<br>
 The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a colossal thing existed.<br>

<h2><b>Surface</h2></b>
As a gas giant, Saturn doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a<br>
 spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures<br>
 and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.<br>


<h2><b>Atmosphere</h2></b>
Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet streams, and storms. The planet is many different shades<br>
 of yellow, brown, and gray.<br><center><img src="SATURN.jpeg"></center>

Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second) in the equatorial region. In contrast,<br>
 the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 360 feet per second (110 meters per second). <br>
And the pressure – the same kind you feel when you dive deep underwater – is so powerful it squeezes gas into a liquid.<br>

<h2><b>URANUS
</h2></b>
Uranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 28 small moons. Uranus <br>
rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin <br>
sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.<br><br><center><img src="33.jpg"></center>

<br>Uranus’ environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that <br>
characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br>

Size and Distance
With an equatorial diameter of 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers), Uranus is four times wider than Earth. <br>
If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.<br>

From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is about 19 astronomical<br>
 units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From<br>
this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.<br>

<h2><b>Orbit and Rotation</h2></b>
One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours. This is the amount of time it takes Uranus to rotate, or spin once around <br>
its axis. Uranus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Uranian time) in about 84 Earth years (30,687 Earth days).<br>

<h2><b>Moons</h2></b>
Uranus has 28 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from Greek or <br>
Roman mythology, Uranus’ moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.<br>

All of Uranus’ inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The composition of the outer moons <br>
remains unknown, but they are likely captured asteroids.<br>

<h2><b>Rings</h2></b>
Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings consists mostly of narrow, dark grey rings. There<br>
 are two outer rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar system, and the outer <br>
ring is blue like Saturn's E ring.<br>

In order of increasing distance from the planet, the rings are called Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma,<br>
 Delta, Lambda, Epsilon, Nu, and Mu. Some of the larger rings are surrounded by belts of fine dust.<br>

<h2><b>Formation</h2></b>
Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago – when gravity pulled<br>
 swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Neptune, Uranus likely formed closer to the <br>
Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago, where it is the seventh planet from the Sun.<br>

<h2><b>Structure</h2></b>
Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the<br>
 planet’s mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of “icy” materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small rocky core.<br>
 Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).<br>

Uranus is slightly larger in diameter than its neighbor Neptune, yet smaller in mass. It is the second least <br>
dense planet; Saturn is the least dense of all.<br><center><img src="333.jpg"></center>

<h2><b>Surface</h2></b>
As an ice giant, Uranus doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling fluids. While a spacecraft<br>
 would have nowhere to land on Uranus, it wouldn’t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either. <br>
The extreme pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft.<br>

<h2><b>Atmosphere</h2></b>
Uranus’ atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of water and <br>
ammonia. The methane gives Uranus its signature blue color.<br>

While Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot, and a small dark spot during its flyby <br>
in 1986 – more recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as it approaches equinox, <br>
including rapidly changing bright features.<br>

Uranus’ planetary atmosphere, with a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) makes it even <br>
colder than Neptune in some places.<br>

<h2><b>NEPTUNE</h2></b>
Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.<br><br><center><img src="44.jpg"></center>

<br>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far from the Sun as<br>
 Earth. Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed<br>
 its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.<br>

Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us.<br>
 The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.<br>

Neptune’s environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials<br> 
that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme, and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br>

<h2><b>Size and Distance</h2></b>
With an equatorial diameter of 30,775 miles (49,528 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth.<br>
 If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.<br>

From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units away<br>
 from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this<br>
 distance, it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.<br>

<h2><b>Orbit and Rotation</h2></b>
One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate or spin once). And Neptune makes <br>
a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth days).<br><center><img src="4444.jpg"></center>

<h2><b>Moons</h2></b>
Neptune has 16 known moons. Neptune’s largest moon Triton was discovered on Oct. 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just <br>
17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea,<br>
 its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.<br>

<h2><b>Rings</h2></b>
Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs that we know of so far. Starting near the planet <br>
and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. The rings are thought <br>
to be relatively young and short-lived.<br>

<h2><b>Formation</h2></b>
Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled<br>
 swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely formed closer to the<br>
 Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago.<br><center><img src="444.jpg"></center>

<h2><b>Structure</h2></b>
Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the planet’s<br>
 mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of “icy” materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core. Of<br>
 the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.

Scientists think there might be an ocean of super hot water under Neptune’s cold clouds.<br> It does not boil away because <br>
incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside.<br>

<h2><b>Surface</h2></b>
Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends to <br>
great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth.<br>

<h2><b>Atmosphere</h2></b>
Neptune’s atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Neptune’s<br>
 neighbor Uranus has a similar makeup; the methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue, giving these ice<br>
 giants their similar hue. Many images of Neptune, coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, show Neptune as a much <br>
deeper blue. This was because the Voyager team tweaked the images, to better reveal clouds and other distinctive features<br>
 on the planet, compared to the hazy, uniform view of Uranus that Voyager 2 had captured in 1986. Researchers <br>
in 2024 re-processed the images, showing the planets look much more alike than many thought.<br>
