<h1><center><u>THE SUN</h1></u>
<br><center><address>The Sun is a medium-sized star that is the closest one to Earth.</center></address>

<h2><br>The Sun’s Formation and Structure</h2>
 
<u><b>The Sun</u></b> formed about<b> 4.6 billion years ago</b> from the gravitational collapse of matter <br>within a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, 
forming the Sun, while the rest flattened<br> into a disk that became the solar system. <b><u>The Sun’s core</b></u> is 
the hottest part, reaching temperatures of <b>27 million degrees<br> Fahrenheit</b> (15 million degrees Celsius). This is where nuclear fusion occurs, converting <u>hydrogen</u><br> into <u>helium</u> and releasing immense energy.
 
<br><h4><u>The Sun's Interior is divided into several zones:</u></h4>
 
<br><b>-Core:</b> The innermost region where nuclear fusion takes place.
 
<br><br><b>-Radiative zone:</b>  Energy from the core is transported outward through radiation.

 
<br><br><b>-Convective zone:</b>  Hot plasma rises and cooler plasma sinks, carrying energy to the surface.
 
<h2>The Sun’s Atmosphere and Activity</h2>
 
<h4><u>The Sun’s atmosphere consists of several layers:</h4></u>
 
<br><b>-Photosphere:</b> The visible surface of the Sun, emitting the light we see.
 
<br><br><b>-Chromosphere:</b> A thin layer above the photosphere, hotter than the photosphere.

 
<br><br><b>-Transition region:</b> A thin layer where the chromosphere rapidly heats and becomes the corona.
 
<br><br><b>-Corona:</b> The Sun’s expansive outer atmosphere, reaching temperatures of 3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit (2 million degrees Celsius).

 
<br><br><h4><u>The Sun exhibits a range of activity, including:</h4></u>
 
<br><b>-Sunspots:</b> Darker, cooler areas on the Sun’s surface caused by magnetic field lines.
 
<br><br><b>-Solar flares:</b> Violent eruptions of energy and particles from the Sun’s surface.

 
<br><br><b>-Coronal mass ejections (CMEs):</b> Giant explosions of plasma and magnetic field lines that can reach Earth.
 
<h2>The Sun's Influence on Earth</h2>
 
<b>The Sun’s energy</b> is essential for life on Earth, providing light, heat, and the basis for photosynthesis. <br>However, solar activity can also impact Earth, causing:
 
<br><br><b>-Auroras:</b> Colorful displays of light in the sky caused by charged particles from <br>the Sun interacting with Earth’s atmosphere.
 
<br><br><b>-Space weather:</b> Disruptions to satellites, GPS, and radio communications caused by solar storms.

 
<h2>The Sun's Future</h2>
 
<b><u>The Sun</b></u> is expected to continue burning for another 5 billion years before it runs out of hydrogen fuel. It will then <br>expand into a <b>red giant star</b>, engulfing Mercury and Venus, and possibly Earth. Eventually, <br>the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a white dwarf, a dense, cooling star.

<br><br><h4>Some additional aspects:</h4>
 
<br><b>- Solar Wind:</b> The Sun constantly emits a stream of charged particles called the <b>solar wind</b>.<br> It travels throughout the solar system and interacts with Earth’s magnetic field.
 
<br><br><br><b>- Solar Cycle:</b> The Sun’s activity varies in an 11-year cycle, with periods of high and low activity. <br>During periods of high activity, there are more sunspots, solar flares, and CMEs.
 
<br><br><br><b>- Sun’s Composition:</b>  The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 70%) and helium <br>(about 28%), with trace amounts of other elements.
 
<br><br><br><b>- Sun’s Rotation:</b>The Sun rotates on its axis, but it doesn’t rotate like a solid object.<br> Different parts of the Sun rotate at different speeds.
 
<br><br><br><b>- Sun’s Gravity:</b> The Sun’s immense gravity holds all the planets in our solar system in orbit around it.
 
<br><br><br><b>- Sun’s Magnetic Field:</b>  The Sun has a powerful magnetic field that extends far beyond its surface.<br> This field plays a crucial role in the Sun’s activity and its influence on Earth.


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the <b>eight planets.</b><br> In order from the Sun, there are four <em>terrestrial planets</em> <b>(Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars)</b>; two <em>gas giants</em> <b>(Jupiter and Saturn)</b>;<br> and two <em>ice giants</em> <b>(Uranus and Neptune)</b>. <br>All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a <em>definite surface</em>, as they are mainly composed of <b>gases and liquids</b>. <br>Over <b>99.86%</b> of the Solar System’s mass is in the Sun and nearly <b>90%</b> of the remaining mass is in <em>Jupiter and Saturn.</em>

<p>There is a strong consensus among astronomers that the Solar System has at least <strong>nine dwarf planets:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Ceres</li>
<li>Orcus</li>
<li>Pluto</li>
<li>Haumea</li>
<li>Quaoar</li>
<li>Makemake</li>
<li>Gonggong</li>
<li>Eris</li>
<li>and Sedna.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>There are a vast number of small Solar System bodies, such as:
<p>
<ul>
<li>asteroids
<li>comets
<li>centaurs
<li>meteoroids
<li>and interplanetary dust clouds. 
</ul>
</p>

<br><br>Some of these bodies are in the <b>asteroid belt</b> <em>(between Mars’s and Jupiter’s orbit)</em> and the <b>Kuiper belt</b> <em>(just outside Neptune’s orbit)</em>.<br>Six planets, seven dwarf planets, and other bodies have orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly called <b>moons.</b>

<br><b>The Solar System</b> is constantly flooded by the Sun’s charged particles, the solar wind, forming the <strong>heliosphere.
<align=left>			
</strong><br><br> Around <u>75–90</u> astronomical units from the Sun, <b>the solar wind</b> is halted, resulting in the <i>heliopause.</i> <br>The <em>outermost region</em> of the Solar System is the <b>theorized Oort cloud</b>, <dfn>the source for long-period comets, extending to a radius of 2,000–200,000 AU.</dfn> <br>The <em>closest star</em> to the Solar System, <b>Proxima Centauri,</b> is <b>4.25 light-years (269,000 AU) away</b>. <br>Both stars belong to the <u>Milky Way galaxy</u>.
