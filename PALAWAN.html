<center><u><h1>THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h1></u>
<em>The solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, 
<br>Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus & Neptune.
There are five officially recognized dwarf planets<br>
in our solar system: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake & Eris</em><br>The Solar system is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.<br>It formed about <u>4.6 billion years ago</u> when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the <b>Sun and a protoplanetary disc</b></center>.<br><br><br><br><br><h2>THE SUN</h2>
-The Sun is a yellow dwarf located at the center of our solar system.<br>
-It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced <br>by nuclear fusion reactions at its core.<br>
-The Sun is by far the largest object in our solar system, containing 99.86% <br>of its total mass.
<br>-The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of <em>hydrogen into helium</em> at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. <br>Astronomers classify it as a <b>G-type main-sequence star.</b></dd></dl></p>

<br><br><br><br><br><h1><b><center><u>PLANETS</b></h1></center></u>




<br><br><h2>MERCURY</h2>
- Mercury: The smallest planet in our solar system, Mercury is also the closest to the Sun.<br> Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling the Moon, <br>and it experiences extreme temperature variations due to its lack of atmosphere.

<br><br><br>
<h2><b>VENUS</b></h2>

- Venus: Venus is the hottest planet, with a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.  <br>This extreme heat is due to a runaway greenhouse effect caused <br>by its dense atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide.

<br><br><br>
<h2><b>EARTH</h2></b>

- Earth:  Our home planet, Earth is unique in our solar system for possessing <br>liquid water on its surface and supporting a wide variety of life. <br>Its atmosphere provides protection from harmful solar radiation <br>and regulates temperature.

<br><br><br>
<h2><b>MARS</h2></b>

- Mars: Often called the "Red Planet" due to the iron oxide prevalent on its surface, <br>Mars is a cold, desert world with a thin atmosphere.  <br>Scientists are actively searching for evidence of past or present life on Mars.

<br><br><br>
<h2><b>JUPITER</h2></b>

- Jupiter: The largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. <br>Its iconic Great Red Spot is a massive, long-lived storm larger than Earth.

<br><br><br>
<h2><b>SATURN</h2></b>


- Saturn: Famous for its spectacular ring system, Saturn is another gas giant with a composition similar to Jupiter. <br> These rings are made up of countless icy particles and dust.

<br><br><br>
<h2><b>URANUS</h2></b>


- Uranus: An ice giant, Uranus has a unique axial tilt of nearly 90 degrees, meaning it essentially rotates on its side. 
<br>This extreme tilt leads to unusual and long seasons.

<br><br><br>
<h2><b>NEPTUNE</h2></b>

- Neptune: The farthest planet from the Sun, Neptune is a dark, cold, and incredibly windy ice giant.<br> It was the first planet to be discovered through mathematical predictions <br>rather than direct observation.
